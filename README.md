# Personal Finance Tracker

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Managing personal finances is a challenge for many, especially when trying to track income, expenses, and savings manually.

## ✅ Recommendations

   - Rent and groceries make up a significant portion of total expenses which account for 65% of total spending. Consider budget adjustments to reduce cost or Explore cost-saving measures like meal planning or 
     reviewing housing options.

2. **Increase Savings Rate**  
   - Despite a healthy income, the savings percentage can be improved. Setting automated transfers can enforce better savings discipline.

3. **Limit Credit Dependency**
